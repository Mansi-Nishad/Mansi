  <dl>
    <dt>Frontend Frameworks</dt>
    <dd>Frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js that handle the presentation layer of the application in the user's browser.</dd>

    <dt>Backend Frameworks</dt>
    <dd>Frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails that handle server-side logic, database interactions, and application structure.</dd>

    <dt>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</dt>
    <dd>Software like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL used to store, manage, and retrieve data for the application.</dd>
